# Coding_Challenge_HBLL
Coding Challenge to prepare for an interview

Complete the tasks in any order and in any language. You may use helper functions
if desired.

1: Write a function that will reverse the given input string.
For Example: function("string") -> "gnirts"

2: Write a function that accepts three integers as input and returns as output the
largest of the three.
For Example: function(1, 3, 2) -> 3
3: Write a function that calculates the factorial of an input integer using recursion.
Factorial: n! = n * (n-1) * (n-2) * ... * 1, so 3! = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6
For Example: function(3) = 6
4: Write a function that calculates the Nth entry of the Fibonacci sequence (Do not
include 0 in the sequence).
Fibonacci Sequence: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ...
The sequence is calculated by summing two numbers and adding the sum to the
sequence.
1 (the sequence starts with 1)
1 + 0 = 1 (1 was the only element, so add 0, then put the result on the end of the
sequence
1, 1
1 + 1 = 2
1, 1, 2
1 + 2 = 3
1, 1, 2, 3
2 + 3 = 5
1, 1, 2, 3, 5
etc.
So your function should behave as
function(1) -> 1
function(2) -> 1
function(3) -> 2
function(4) -> 3
function(5) -> 5
etc.
